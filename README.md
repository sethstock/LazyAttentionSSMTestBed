# LazyAttentionSSMTestBed
Repository to centralize development thrusts on the LazyAttentionSSM, which I have designed as a competitor to the Transformer architecture. Right now, it is vastly superior to transformers in windowed and multi-timestep future prediction, seen in the crypto model. It is currently being tested in an LLM and a UNet Image Gen Architecture.
